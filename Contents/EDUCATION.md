        >WebGoat is a deliberately insecure web application maintained by [OWASP](http://www.owasp.org/) designed to teach web application security lessons.

        >This program is a demonstration of common server-side application flaws. The
        exercises are intended to be used by people to learn about application security and
        penetration testing techniques.
        >
        >**WARNING 1:** *While running this program your machine will be extremely
        vulnerable to attack. You should disconnect from the Internet while using
        this program.*  WebGoat's default configuration binds to localhost to minimize
        the exposure.
        >
        >**WARNING 2:** *This program is for educational purposes only. If you attempt
        these techniques without authorization, you are very likely to get caught. If
        you are caught engaging in unauthorized hacking, most companies will fire you.
        Claiming that you were doing security research will not work as that is the
        first thing that all hackers claim.*

  - [Introduction to Computer Security <sub>by Michael Goodrich and Roberto Tamassia</sub>](https://www.securitybook.net/home)
      >Introduction to Computer Security, does NOT focus on the mathematical and computational foundations of security, and it does not assume an extensive background in computer science. Instead it looks at the systems, technology, management, and policy side of security, and offers students fundamental security concepts and a working knowledge of threats and countermeasures with “just-enough” background in computer science. 
      >
      >*This has a lot of good resources for understanding typical CS security concerns. You can also find good documentation in the project sections explaining how some of these attacks and what countermeasures exist.*

      >Provides information and data to educate software development professionals on the concept, applicability, and value of software security principles. It will also contain a set of key secure software principles to assist software development professionals in analyzing and creating their software architectures from a security perspective and in gaining a greater understanding of the key underlying concepts and patterns that, depending on how they are addressed, can make software either more or less secure.

    >The OWASP Cheat Sheet Series was created to provide a set of simple good practice guides for application developers and defenders to follow. Rather than focused on detailed best practices that are impractical for many developers and applications, they are intended to provide good practices that the majority of developers will actually be able to implement.
    >
    >The OWASP Cheat Sheet Series was created to provide a concise collection of high value information on specific application security topics. These cheat sheets were created by various application security professionals who have expertise in specific topics.
    >
    >We hope that this project provides you with excellent security guidance in an easy to read format. 😄
