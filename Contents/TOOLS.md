  ## Playgrounds
  - [DVTA v2 Vulnerable Thick Client Application](https://github.com/srini0x00/dvta)<image height="24px" align="right" src="/images/csharp.svg">
    >DVTA is a Vulnerable Thick Client Application developed in C# .NET
    >
    >Most of the vulnerabilities that were built into DVTA were found during my real world pentests.
  - [WebGoat.NET](https://github.com/jerryhoff/WebGoat.NET)<image height="24px" align="right" src="/images/csharp.svg">
    >This web application is a learning platform that attempts to teach about common web security flaws. It contains generic security flaws that apply to most web applications. It also contains lessons that specifically pertain to the .NET framework. The excercises in this app are intented to teach about web security attacks and how developers can overcome them.
  - [WebGoat 8](https://github.com/WebGoat/WebGoat)<image height="24px" align="right" src="/images/owasp.svg">
      >WebGoat is a deliberately insecure web application maintained by [OWASP](http://www.owasp.org/) designed to teach web application security lessons.
      >
      >This program is a demonstration of common server-side application flaws. The
      exercises are intended to be used by people to learn about application security and
      penetration testing techniques.
      >
      >**WARNING 1:** *While running this program your machine will be extremely
      vulnerable to attack. You should disconnect from the Internet while using
      this program.*  WebGoat's default configuration binds to localhost to minimize
      the exposure.
      >
      >**WARNING 2:** *This program is for educational purposes only. If you attempt
      these techniques without authorization, you are very likely to get caught. If
      you are caught engaging in unauthorized hacking, most companies will fire you.
      Claiming that you were doing security research will not work as that is the
      first thing that all hackers claim.*
  - [Juice Shop](https://github.com/bkimminich/juice-shop)<image height="24px" align="right" src="/images/owasp.svg"><image height="24px" align="right" src="/images/juiceshop.png">
    >*Fantastic source for learning vulnerabilities using modern web technologies.*
    >
    >OWASP Juice Shop is probably the most modern and sophisticated insecure web application! It can be used in security trainings, awareness demos, CTFs and as a guinea pig for security tools! Juice Shop encompasses vulnerabilities from the entire OWASP Top Ten along with many other security flaws found in real-world applications!
